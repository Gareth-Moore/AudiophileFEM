check the font-size on the productAddToCart heading. It should be 40/28/28 (not 40/40/28)
on individual product pages 'new product' is only on some of the products

go back and make sure all the button/links are providing the correct navigation 
add scroll to top functionality when navigating in the same page (i.e. changing from 'headphones' to 'speakers')

pay more attention to HTML semantics. For example each page uses div's and there are no articles or sections.
